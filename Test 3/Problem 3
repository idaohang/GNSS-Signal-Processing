Problem 3)

I ran my program several times and got very different numbers,

White frequency noise of 0.01 rad/sec
Tcoh = 38.11 sec

White frequency rate noise of 0.0001 rad/sec^2
Tcoh = 1.79 sec

White phase noise of 0.8 rad
Tcoh = N/A 		% I was unable to run through this one, it kept freezing my computer
